# NeatPad

A minimalistic but powerful notepad app with a clean UI. What sets it apart from the other notepad apps is the idea of writing formatted notes in the Markdown (and eventually LaTeX) languages, storing the files in plaintext, and tagging + quick append features. The goal of Neatpad is to be a very efficient, clean, and powerful note taking app.
