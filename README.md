# neatpad
A minimalistic but powerful notepad app with a clean UI. What would set it apart from the other notepad apps would be the theme of writing formatted notes in the Markdown and LaTeX languages, storing the files in plaintext, and the tagging + quick append features. The goal of Neatpad would be to be a very efficient, clean, and powerful note taking app.
